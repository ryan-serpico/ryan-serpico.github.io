Hi, I'm Ryan Serpico.

I'm the Deputy Director of Newsrooms AI and Automation for [Hearst Newspapers' Devhub](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/about-the-devhub-hearst-newspapers/). I build things that help journalists do the important work that they do.

I'm based out of San Antonio, Texas, where I've been since I joined the [San Antonio Express-News](https://www.expressnews.com/) in 2020 as a digital producer.
